  summary: These are miscellaneous functions for working with panel data, quantiles, and printing
    results.  For panel data, the package includes functions for making a panel data
    balanced (that is, dropping missing individuals that have missing observations in
    any time period), converting id numbers to row numbers, and to treat repeated cross
    sections as panel data under the assumption of rank invariance.  For quantiles,
    there are functions to make distribution functions from a set of data points (this
    is particularly useful when a distribution function is created in several steps),
    to combine distribution functions based on some external weights, and to invert
    distribution functions.  Finally, there are several other miscellaneous functions
    for obtaining weighted means, weighted distribution functions, and weighted quantiles;
    to generate summary statistics and their differences for two groups; and to add
    or drop covariates from formulas.
